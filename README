In this study, the traveling salesman problem is studied and a mixed integer 
mathematical model is presented. In the context of this project, single vehicle is considered.
The objective of the model is to minimize the total distance which corresponds to minimizing
the total traveling time. While small-sized problems are solved by GAMS, a solution
procedure based on Simulated Annealing is applied for large-sized problems. In the first
phase of this procedure, a solution is generated by employing the nearest neighborhood
heuristic. This solution is then improved by Simulated Annealing. The performance of the
procedure is validated using the optimal solutions obtained by GAMS.
